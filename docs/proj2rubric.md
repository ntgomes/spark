by Neeloy Gomes, Abhishek Gupta, Vishal Veera Reddy, and Abhimanyu Bellam

[Link to Software Sustainability Evaluation](/docs/sustainabilityEvaluation.pdf)


This rubric was prepared by using a table that follows as below:
-   Column1 has all the following points PLUS all the points from the [Software Sustainability Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform).
-   Column2 is your self-assessment. For each items, score yourself zero (none), one (a litte), two (somewhat), three (a lot).
-   Column3 is for any links you are adding to support your claim in column two.
-   At the top, show the sum of column2

|Notes|Score|Links & Support|
|-----|---------|---------|
| _Total_ | **282** | Overall, this is a strong codebase given the Project 2 rubric (max 300 points)|
|Video1 : A 5min video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from old.| 3 | The video showing all the new changes and revamped functionality can be found within our [documentation folder](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/docs/spark_demo.mp4), our [documentation website](https://ntgomes.github.io/spark), or from the README.md. It is a significant delta from Project 1 code. | 
|Bonus: Xfold improvement	In some aspect of the code; theoretical complexity, runtime, memory, developer time... | 2 | Better test coverage (see [here](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark#------overview----------installation-----------long-term-objectives)), much better documentation website and diagrams (now it is part of [GitHub Pages](https://ntgomes.github.io/spark/) instead of a local copy) which improves developer/onboarding time, increased functionality on user experience (breakout rooms, file transfer, revamped UI, chat utilities, mute all -- see black box tests), at least 400% increase on number of users per room (see TestConnectingWithMultipleUsers in black box tests) | 
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 3 | Documentation website has many different linking HTML pages including descriptions of each individual function/class. This matches up the plethora of code comments for all the Spark source files. In addition, we have [high-level diagrams](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/docs/diagrams.md) showing all the changes. |
|Use of style checkers | 3 | Style checker can be found [here](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/.eslintrc.json) |
|Use of code formatters. | 3 | Used [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/) for code-formatting ([Evidence here](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/.prettierrc)). Ran using `npm run format` to format all the `javascript` files |
|Use of syntax checkers. | 3 | [**Eslint**](https://eslint.org/) used for syntax checking ([Evidence here](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/.github/workflows/lint.yml)), ran as a part of commit pipeline |
|Use of code coverage | 3 | Code Coverage is done by `nyc`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/package.json), ran using `npm run coverage` and also ran as a part of commit pipeline [Evidence](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml) |
|Other automated analysis tools| 3 | Used CodeQL and Dependabot to find security issues and enabled other github security workflows. [Evidence1](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml), [Evidence2](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/security/code-scanning), and [Evidence 3](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/pull/58) |
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others, but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 2 | From [GH Insights](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/graphs/contributors), team members on average are each responsible for 19 commits. The majority of our commits were each significant and heavy. Participant commit distribution is less than average and most group members have committed a net 500-1000 lines of code as well.  |
|Number of commits| 3 | From GH commits. Overall [100+ commits](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/graphs/commit-activity) made to main. |
|Number of commits: by different people| 2 | From [GH Insights](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/pulse). 3 members of the group committed approximately 3 times as much as the other group members. However, some people's commits had more code included in it, hence the 2 rather than 1.  |
|Issues reports: there are **many**| 3 | At least [40 issues listed](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/pulse), each with several areas for improvement listed and/or specific tasks within the issue to be fixed. In addition, [issue templates](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) were used demonstrating thoroughness.  |
|Issues are being closed| 3 | At the time of submission, all key (36) issues have sparked discussions with teammates and have been closed. The only issues NOT closed are bug reports and feature requests that were not covered due to a team member leaving the team without having worked on those assigned issues, or were outside the scope of the project respectively. |
|DOI badge: exists| 3 | From GH within [README.md](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/README.md). It also is found within the citation document and about us section of repo.|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 3 | Documentation is generated and hosted publically. All .md files within repo are neatly organized, link to other areas and support users ease of use. Website documentation has css file included to ensure it looks nice and is easily navigable. The following picture is part of our online documentation and shows the nice look. ![online doc](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/docs/documentation_photos/online_doc.png) |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 3 | Mini tutorials included in [README.md](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/README.md) and [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/INSTALL.md). In addition, our marketing 5 minute video contains a demo showcasing gesture recognition and all other functionality.|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 3 | [README.md](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/README.md) is engaging and includes eye catching images, phrases about how users can benefit from the software, and an overview of of setup/running the software. The linked video is clear and attracts users.|  
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 3 | Great animated video on [README.md](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/README.md) that shows why people should use the tool and launches into a brief demo. Anouther copy of the video can be found within our [documentation folder](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/docs/spark_demo.mp4) | 
|Use of version control tools| 3 | Git utilized. Over 14 branches utilized and some commits reverted to. Proper version control practices were upheld.|
|Test cases exist| 3 | Test Cases exist ([Evidence](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/tree/main/test)) and are ran as a part of commit workflow ([Evidence](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml)) |
|Test cases are routinely executed| 3 | Executed as part of Commit Pipeline ([Evidence](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml))|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3 |  [Contribution](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) information is up to date. Links are included within the file to point to additional resources or areas on the git page that should be used when contributing. |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed| 3 | Issues include comments about the status of the issue before being closed. One such example of a discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/issues/7) |
|Chat channel: exists| 3 | Chat channel is available and is activly used. It was started on October 10, 2022. While no 'statistic' insights are available within discord, the chat channel averages 15-35 messages a day regarding deliverables, scheduling meetings, code debugging and feature ideation. A small screen shot of a sample of text has been extracted as evidence: ![discord evidence](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/docs/documentation_photos/discord_evidence.png). For more details about the discord conversation, you can join the channel [here](https://discord.gg/aGJDtPmF) |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.| 3 | In our case, test cases did not make up a large portion of the issues because our test cases were passing for most of our changes. We had 6/40 issues throughout the development (not including issues for project's future development).|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | All members contributing across branches. Development/testing has occured on multiple machines. Package.json and package-lock.json provide a listing of the dependencies needed so that each participant can instantiate a directory with the same parameters. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 2 | Config file was updated frequently by one member. But everyone used the same syntax and formatter configs. [Evidence 1](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/jsdoc.json) |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3 | The entire team has access to the repository and is able to run the demo. We ensured this by having different members screen share and run the program during troubleshooting sessions.  | 
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3 | Most participants working across areas with a primary focus on one area. - Abhimanyu, Abhishek, and Vishal supported frontend development, but also worked on implementing backend data structures and socket io communication. Neeloy provided a lot of bug fixes, documentation, black box tests, and adjusting several GitHub workflows throughout the whole codebase. Abhimanyu worked on testing and debugging as well. |
|Short release cycles | 2 |  Only 3 releases over the course of the entire project, however, considering the span of the project, it is a somewhat significant number of releases to do over a month. Release cycles are irregular, hence the 2. |
|Does the website and documentation provide a clear, high-level overview of the software? | 3 | Yes. The website and README both provide comprehensive evidence of the softwares functionality, setup and use. |
|Does the website and documentation clearly describe the type of user who should use the software? | 3 |Yes. The website and documentation share what other users have done with this software. |
|Did the team publish case studies to show how the software has been used by team and others? | 1 | Not really. Previously, the software has information regarding how users have successfully used this software. However, this is on a small scale. Moving forward, beta testing should be conducted with a user pool to improve our success stories. | 
|Is the name of the project/software unique? | 3 | Spark by itself isn’t unique for names of software. I can say “spark software” and can get plenty of other software, repos, etc. But that's from Project 1. | 
|Is the project/software name free from trademark violations? | 3 | See [here](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=toc&state=4807%3Ae0vez6.1.1&p_search=searchss&p_L=50&BackReference=&p_plural=yes&p_s_PARA1=&p_tagrepl%7E%3A=PARA1%24LD&expr=PARA1+AND+PARA2&p_s_PARA2=spark&p_tagrepl%7E%3A=PARA2%24COMB&p_op_ALL=ADJ&a_default=search&a_search=Submit+Query&a_search=Submit+Query). From this it’s mostly clear that if this software were to garner any major attention, there could be trademark violations. But that's from Project 1. | 
|Is the software available as a package that can be deployed without building it? | 3 | The software is also available as a package and can also be deployed without the need for the user for building, although its always better to use repo instead of package due to compatibility issues.| 
|Is the software available for free? | 3 |  [Licensed under MIT](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/LICENSE) | 
|Is the source code publicly available to download, either as a downloadable bundle or via access to a source code repository? | 3 | Public repo available for cloning and can be downloaded on Zenodo as well. |  
|Is the software hosted in an established, third-party repository likeGitHub (https://github.com), BitBucket (https://bitbucket.org),LaunchPad (https://launchpad.net) orSourceForge (https://sourceforge.net)? | 3 | Hosted by GitHub and Zenodo | 
|Is the documentation clearly available on your website or within your software? | 3 | The website documentation is clearly available on the app documentation website and is stated that full documentation can be found on the websiite within the README. |  
|Does the documentation include a "quick start" guide, that provides a short overview of how to use the software with some basic examples of use? | 3 | In addition to having a demo video show the functionalities, there is also a user work flow section of the readme that describes an overview of how to use the software. |  
|If team has provided more extensive documentation, does this provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to deploy and use the software? | 3 | The documentation provided is extensive. The [README](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/README.md) has overview information and the [results](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/docs/results.md) shows testing and coverage information. The [install guide](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/INSTALL.md) has user workflows and information about how to install the software. Then automated documentation has been generated as well and can be launched as a start guide. Step by step inforamtion has been provided as well as comprehensive troubleshooting steps and access to a development email account to discuss issues on a one-on-one basis. | 
|Did the team provide a comprehensive guide to all the software’s commands, functions and options? | 3 | Yes. The software functions are described in the [user guide](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/README.md) and the sequence to begin the software can be accessed through a help menu in the terminal as well. |
|Did the team provide troubleshooting information that describes the symptoms and step-by-step solutions for problems and error messages? | 2 | There is a [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting_guide.md) where users can go to find frequent problems and their potential solutions. This guide includes how the problem typically occurs and potential solutions to fix the issue. With this being said, there is no error messages that people should expect. Providing error messages would help these problems get diagnosed quicker and could be established to improve user experience in future iterations.  |
|If the software can be used as a library, package or service by other software, do the team provide comprehensive API documentation? | 3  | Not applicable. The services can not be used as an API. |  
|Did the team store the documentation under revision control with your source code? | 3 | Yes. All documentation is in the git revision control system. |  
|Did the team publish the release history e.g. release data, version numbers, key features of each release etc. on your web site or in the documentation? | 3 | The key features of each release are specified in the documentation. [Evidence](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/releases/tag/1.0.0) | 
|Does the software describe how a user can get help with using the software? | 3 | Yes. In the [readme](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/README.md), there is a notice about needing additional support which states that a user can submit an issue, read our help/troubleshooting guides, or email our developers email address to get support using the software. |  
|Does the website and documentation describe what support, if any, the team provide to users and developers? | 3 | Yes. In the [README](README.md), there is a notice about needing additional support which states that a user can submit an issue, read our help/troubleshooting guides, or email our developers email address to get support using the software. |  
|Does the project have an e-mail address or forum that is solely for supporting users? | 3 | Yes. The project has an email address (develop.nak@gmail.com) where users can submit questions and support tickets. This email address forwards information on to the associated project members. | 
|Are e-mails to the support e-mail address received by more than one person? | 3 | Yes. The project has an email address (develop.nak@gmail.com) where users can submit questions and support tickets. This email address forwards information on to the associated project members. | 
|Does the project have a ticketing system to manage bug reports and feature requests? | 3 | Yes. A ticketing system exists and feature request and bug report [templates](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) exist for easy logging. | 
|Is the project's ticketing system publicly visible to the users, so they can view bug reports and feature requests? | 3 | Yes, and feature requests and bug reports are publically available [here](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/issues?q=is%3Aissue) |  
| Question 6.1: Is your software’s architecture and design modular? | 2 | Partially. The design is partially modular. Functionality is abstracted into server and client classes. In addition, gesture recognition has its own JS section. This ensures that updating either the user experience or the gesture recognition can be done in an isolated fashion. | 
| Question 6.2: Does your software use an accepted coding standard or convention? | 3 | Yes. Our software integrates [lint](https://github.com/ntgomes/spark/blob/main/.github/workflows/lint.yml) to check coding conventions. We have a check run between each addition of software to main to prevent regressions. | 
| Question 7.1: Does your software allow data to be imported and exported using open data formats? | 3 | Yes, all of the imports and exports of the application in open-data formats are do not change the format submitted or retrieved by the end user. Example: file transfer functionality and blobs.  | 
| Question 7.2: Does your software allow communications using open communications protocols? | 3 | Yes. We are using sockets, which are not a proprietary software. All of the requests between server/client are standard. | 
| Question 8.1: Is your software cross-platform compatible? | 3 | Yes. The system runs in your browser and can be deployed locally or on a server. The browser can be flexible (including but not limited to Brave, Edge, Firefox and Chrome) | 
| Question 9.1: Does your software adhere to appropriate accessibility conventions or standards? | 2 | Yes. Our software remains accessible. The layout of the page is supported by page-to-speak extentions and the colors are within the proper conventions. There could be improvements to the user experience for people with disabilities. | 
| Question 9.2: Does your documentation adhere to appropriate accessibility conventions or standards? | 3 | Yes. Our documentation has light/dark capabilities (within both the repo and on our documentation website). | 
| Question 10.1: Is your source code stored in a repository under revision control? | 3 | Yes. All source code is in the git revision control system.| 
| Question 10.2: Is each source code release a snapshot of the repository? | 3 | Yes. Each release contains all of the source code in the repository. This release snapshot is stored in the Zenodo repo backup location and in the repo. | 
| Question 10.3: Are releases tagged in the repository? | 3 | Releases are tagged on the front page of the repository.  | 
| Question 10.4: Is there a branch of the repository that is always stable? (i.e. tests always pass, code always builds successfully) | 2 | Upon initial development, the main branch of the repository did not always pass. But after the first release occurred and repo restrictions were set up, the main branch was stable and builds/tests has always been passing. | 
| Question 10.5: Do you back-up your repository? | 3 | Yes. Our repository is backed up on Zenodo prior to each release. |
