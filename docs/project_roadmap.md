## Project Roadmap 

To support further development - throughout future academic or personal projects and beyond - we have compiled opportunities for expansion. 

### Overview of Expansion 

Expansion opportunities fall into one of three categories: 
- gesture recognition to improve hands-off capabilities 
- stability improvements for the more than two users in a room
- video conferencing features to improve user experience 
- deployment and increased user access to launch the software on a server to allow users from different networks to connect to improve functionality

These areas for expansion have been broken down further into feature issues and are listed in our [development project board](https://github.com/users/SiddarthR56/projects/1). Tasks belonging to each one of these areas are tagged for easy recognition. 

### Development Timeline 

Possible Future Features: 

| Task | Milestone | Estimated Time to Complete | Rationale | 
|------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Develop additional gestures | Milestone 1 | 10 Days | Begin by training the model with additional gestures. This allows easy integration with the to-be-developed features within the software | 
| Add Virtual Background Option | Milestone 2 | 10 Days | Mediapipe library can be used for image segmentation and addition of virtual backgrounds | 
| Add Transcripts to the call  | Milestone 3 | 1 Week | Use of speech recognition library to display live transcripts during the call | 
| Optimize gesture recognition mode | Milestone 4 | 10 Days | Mediapipe camera utils can be disabled instead of constantly running to reduce load on video processing | 
| Improve user experience | Milestone 5 | 1 Week | Ensure that all needed functionality are included. Potential ideas include gifs, emotes, better breakout rooms, etc. This functionality needs to be implemented to have something to tie the gestures to | 
| Add User login page | Milestone 6 | 3 weeks | Add landing page for user to create an account/login, store login credentials, etc | 

*Note: the estimated timeline is for a single hobbyist developing this software, for an established team software development could be heavily accelerated. It is anticipated that Project 2 should complete Milestone 1-3*
