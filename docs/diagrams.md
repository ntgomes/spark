## Project 2 (12/5/2022)
Below is the high-level diagram for Spark's codebase for Project 2, which shows all the changes made since Project 1. Legend is provided at the top of the diagram. Overall, the major changes were mostly reworked signals for the server-client socket.io connections, the addition of the peer.js server, and the use of the room.ejs file with all of its major buttons for server-client communication. Start with server.js (which is the server code), then views/room.ejs, then public/hand_gesture.js, and finally public/script.js (which is the client code).
